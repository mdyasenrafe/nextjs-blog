        Cashew will remain central to this focus. He concluded that the
        Ministry would uphold its support to the cashew value chain,
        highlighting that his department has trained local farmers on the
        production, processing, and packaging of the commodity. Nigeria
        hosted the 16th ACA conference, showcasing the country’s
        commitment to the development of the cashew trade. After all,
        cocoa, another Nigerian stronghold, is behind cashew when it comes

        <p className="blog_description">
          Notably, last month, Nigeria announced that it plans to raise
          its yearly production capacity of cashew by at least 240,000
          metric tons to meet a new target of 500,000 metric tons each
          year. With this scale-up is the necessity to increase value
          across the cashew value chain. As a result, substantial
          investment is needed in the sector to advance technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_description mt-[24px]">
          The movement of unshelled cashews is causing Nigeria’s farmers
          and economy to lose out on the profits to be made on shelled
          exports. As the Centre for the Promotion of Imports (CBI) puts
          it, production in East and West African nations is increasing
          considerably, but amid a lack of shelling capability, African
          producers export the bulk of their crops as in-shell cashew nuts
          to the likes of Vietnam and India.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_description mt-[24px]">
          Nigerian authorities are incentivising agro-processing to
          maximise income opportunities. Furthermore, foreign countries,
          including India, are beginning to increase investment to improve
          the tech involved in processing within Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p className="blog_description mt-[24px]">
          Altogether, investing in the agro-processing industry can change
          the game for Nigeria, allowing the country to ramp up its
          de-shelled cashew trade and help cater to global demand. Other
          African nations such as Ghana Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso,
          Nigeria, Mozambique, Kenya, and Benin are also starting to
          realize opportunities in this sector. All in all, Africa is
          anticipated to be an all-encompassing powerhouse in the cashew
          industry before the decade is over.

          metric tons to meet a new target of 500,000 metric tons each
          year. With this scale-up is the necessity to increase value

          it, production in East and West African nations is increasing

        Cashews continue to be in high demand across the continents. In
        Europe alone, consumption is rising 5% per annum. With the perfect
        natural conditions to grow cashew trees, Nigeria is a driving
        force behind production. Still, there is room for development when
        it comes to the country’s overall trade of the commodity.

      <p className="blog_description">
        Nigeria has a land mass of nearly a million square kilometres and
        cashews grow across all 36 states of the country. According to
        Statista, the value of shelled and unshelled cashew nuts exported
        from Nigeria peaked at $342,204,000 in 2017. Despite the numbers
        dropping, in part to the initial impact of the pandemic, the
        figures have remained above $190 million ever since.
      </p>
      <p className="blog_description mt-[24px]">
        While fluctuations have occurred, cashew output remains a high
        priority for Nigeria in this next chapter. The country’s
        authorities are keen to oversee a robust industry ahead.

        In August, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr.
